# PYTHON-ALARM-PROJECT
Alarm project in Python


Importing time Module: This allows you to work with time-related functions in Python.

Printing Current Time: print(time.strftime("%H:%M")) prints the current time in HH
format.

Taking User Input: alarmtime = input("Enter the alarm time(HH:MM) :") prompts the user to enter the desired alarm time in HH
format.

While Loop:

while time.strftime("%H:%M") != alarmtime: starts a loop that checks the current time against the alarm time.
time.sleep(1) makes the program wait for 1 second before checking the time again.
Alarm Trigger: Once the current time matches the alarm time specified by the user, the loop exits, and "Time to wake up!" is printed.

Printing Current Time Again: Finally, print(time.strftime("%H:%M")) prints the current time again, confirming the time when the alarm triggered.

Example Usage:
If you run this script and enter an alarm time like 10:30 when prompted, the program will continuously check the current time. Once the system time reaches 10:30, it will print "Time to wake up!" and then print the current time again.

Potential Improvements:
Error handling for invalid user inputs (e.g., non-numeric inputs, incorrect format).
Allow the user to specify AM/PM if needed.
Add a more graceful exit mechanism (currently, the script stops only when the alarm time is reached).
Make sure your environment supports the time module for this script to work correctly.
